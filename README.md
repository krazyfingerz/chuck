# Joke2Email

Good day and thank you for having a look through my code.
1) The react frontend is named <em>joke2email</em>, simply use npm start
2) The PHP code is in <em>chuck_norris</em>, For the frontend admin panel (to add emails), please login with **username: patrick , password: asd**
3) The database is mysql, and there is an exported copy of the mysql database from XAMPP, however I've also provided a copy of the database file itself aptly named "database" and should be renamed to <em>"chuck_norris</em> before copying it into C:\xampp\mysql\data
<br><br><br>
The PHP (chuck_norris) was done with CodeIgniter, let's look at the models, views and controllers folders.
- models points to the table name to be referred to in the mysql database.
