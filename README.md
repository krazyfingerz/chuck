# Joke2Email

Good day and thank you for having a look through my code.
1) The react frontend is named <em>joke2email</em>, simply use npm start
2) The PHP code is in <em>chuck_norrs</em>, 
3) The database is mysql, and there is an exported copy of the mysql database from XAMPP, however I've also provided a copy of the database file itself aptly named "database" and should be renamed to <em>"chuck_norris</em> before copying it into C:\xampp\mysql\data
